# El Badr Marble Company Database Project

## Overview
This documentation outlines the database structure and key queries for the El Badr Marble Company project. The database is designed to manage various aspects of the company's operations, including client information, employee data, order management, and inventory.

## Database Structure

### Tables
The database consists of the following tables:

1. **Clients**: Stores information about the company's clients.
2. **Employee**: Contains data related to the company's employees.
3. **Finish**: (Purpose to be specified - potentially related to completed orders or product finishes)
4. **Managers_of_orders**: Likely contains information about employees managing orders.
5. **Material**: Stores data about the materials used or sold by the company.
6. **Orders**: Contains information about customer orders.
7. **Task_order**: Likely relates to specific tasks associated with orders.

### Relations
(Note: The specific relations between tables are not provided in the source document. It's recommended to detail the relationships between these tables, including primary and foreign keys.)

## Key Queries

The database supports various queries for business operations and analysis. Some examples include:

1. **Maximum Salary**
   - Purpose: To find the highest salary among employees.
   - SQL Example (assuming 'salary' is a field in the Employee table):
     ```sql
     SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee;
     ```

2. **Number of Clients**
   - Purpose: To count the total number of clients.
   - SQL Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Clients;
     ```

3. **Search for Material Price**
   - Purpose: To find the price of a specific material (e.g., 'trista').
   - SQL Example (assuming 'name' and 'price' are fields in the Material table):
     ```sql
     SELECT price FROM Material WHERE name = 'trista';
     ```

4. **Details of All Orders**
   - Purpose: To retrieve comprehensive information about all orders.
   - SQL Example (This would likely involve joining multiple tables):
     ```sql
     SELECT o.*, c.name AS client_name, m.name AS material_name
     FROM Orders o
     JOIN Clients c ON o.client_id = c.id
     JOIN Material m ON o.material_id = m.id;
     ```

## Recommendations for Further Documentation

1. **Table Schemas**: Provide detailed schemas for each table, including field names, data types, and constraints.
2. **Relationships**: Clearly define the relationships between tables, specifying primary and foreign keys.
3. **Indexing**: Document any indexes created for performance optimization.
4. **Access Control**: Outline user roles and their access levels to different parts of the database.
5. **Data Flow**: Describe how data typically flows through the system, from order creation to completion.
6. **Backup and Recovery**: Document procedures for backing up the database and recovering in case of failures.

## Conclusion

This database structure provides a foundation for managing the operations of El Badr Marble Company. It allows for tracking of clients, employees, materials, and orders, enabling efficient business processes and data analysis.
